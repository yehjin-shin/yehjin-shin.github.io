I am a Ph.D. student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), advised by Professor [Noseong Park](https://sites.google.com/view/npark/home?authuser=0). Having completed my Master’s at Yonsei University, I am driven by a deep passion for applying deep learning techniques to temporal and tabular data. My current research focuses on sequential recommendation systems, exploring temporal patterns in user behavior to enhance predictive models. Recently, I’ve also developed a strong interest in sequential architectures like Transformers and Mamba, aiming to better understand and improve how these models handle complex sequences. Here is a full [Curriculum Vitae](https://yehjin-shin.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
